# Description 

I conducted a comprehensive review of pandas basics, covering essential aspects such as importing datasets, exploratory analysis, and basic plotting. Subsequently, I expanded my expertise to encompass common marketing metrics, mastering their calculation using pandas. This knowledge was further applied to visualize results and refine skills in user segmentation.

To streamline and enhance marketing analysis, I developed customized functions designed to automate repetitive tasks. This involved a focus on investigating factors contributing to lower-than-expected conversion rates across specific marketing channels.

Building on this foundation, I delved into the intricacies of A/B testing. Through this exploration, I gained a nuanced understanding of the significance of segmentation in interpreting test results. This experience not only fortified my analytical skills but also underscored the importance of considering diverse user segments when evaluating the effectiveness of marketing strategies.

# About Dataset

## Context
This dataset includes A/B test results of Cookie Cats to examine what happens when the first gate in the game was moved from level 30 to level 40. When a player installed the game, he or she was randomly assigned to either gate_30 or gate_40.

## Content
The data we have is from 90,189 players that installed the game while the AB-test was running. The variables are:

userid: A unique number that identifies each player.
version: Whether the player was put in the control group (gate_30 - a gate at level 30) or the group with the moved gate (gate_40 - a gate at level 40).
sum_gamerounds: the number of game rounds played by the player during the first 14 days after install.
retention_1: Did the player come back and play 1 day after installing?
retention_7: Did the player come back and play 7 days after installing?

When a player installed the game, he or she was randomly assigned to either.
