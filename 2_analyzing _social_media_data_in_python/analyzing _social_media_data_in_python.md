I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Twitter, delving into the intricacies of accessing Twitter APIs and deciphering Twitter JSON structures. Building on this foundation, I acquired the skills to process Twitter text effectively.

Expanding my expertise further, I ventured into network analysis using Twitter data, exploring the complex interconnections within the platform. Subsequently, I honed my abilities in mapping Twitter data, gaining insights into geographical patterns and trends.

This multifaceted exploration of Twitter not only deepened my understanding of social media analytics but also equipped me with the practical skills needed to navigate and extract meaningful insights from the dynamic landscape of Twitter data.
