# Description 

I dedicated focused efforts to understanding and mastering customer analysis techniques, starting with cohorts. In this process, I not only learned the fundamentals but also applied this knowledge to create and analyze my own customer cohorts. I meticulously derived key metrics and effectively visualized the outcomes, demonstrating my proficiency in cohort analysis.

Building on this foundation, I delved into customer segments, gaining exposure to recency, frequency, and monetary value as crucial factors. Leveraging these concepts, I created meaningful customer segments and conducted a thorough analysis of the results. This experience showcased my ability to derive actionable insights from complex customer data.

Recognizing the importance of predictions in customer analysis, I honed my skills in practical data preparation methods. This preparation ensured the effectiveness of the k-means clustering algorithm, guaranteeing the discovery of well-separated and meaningful customer segments. Utilizing the pre-processed data, I successfully identified customer clusters based on recency, frequency, and monetary value.

This comprehensive journey not only showcases my proficiency in customer analysis techniques but also highlights my ability to seamlessly integrate theoretical knowledge with practical applications, fostering a deeper understanding of customer behavior and contributing to data-driven decision-making.


# About Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/retail-transactions-dataset

This dataset was created to simulate a market basket dataset, providing insights into customer purchasing behavior and store operations. The dataset facilitates market basket analysis, customer segmentation, and other retail analytics tasks. Here's more information about the context and inspiration behind this dataset:

## Context

Retail businesses, from supermarkets to convenience stores, are constantly seeking ways to better understand their customers and improve their operations. Market basket analysis, a technique used in retail analytics, explores customer purchase patterns to uncover associations between products, identify trends, and optimize pricing and promotions. Customer segmentation allows businesses to tailor their offerings to specific groups, enhancing the customer experience.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this dataset comes from the need for accessible and customizable market basket datasets. While real-world retail data is sensitive and often restricted, synthetic datasets offer a safe and versatile alternative. Researchers, data scientists, and analysts can use this dataset to develop and test algorithms, models, and analytical tools.
