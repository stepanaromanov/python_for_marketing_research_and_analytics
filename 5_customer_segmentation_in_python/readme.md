# Description 

I dedicated focused efforts to understanding and mastering customer analysis techniques, starting with cohorts. In this process, I not only learned the fundamentals but also applied this knowledge to create and analyze my own customer cohorts. I meticulously derived key metrics and effectively visualized the outcomes, demonstrating my proficiency in cohort analysis.

Building on this foundation, I delved into customer segments, gaining exposure to recency, frequency, and monetary value as crucial factors. Leveraging these concepts, I created meaningful customer segments and conducted a thorough analysis of the results. This experience showcased my ability to derive actionable insights from complex customer data.

Recognizing the importance of predictions in customer analysis, I honed my skills in practical data preparation methods. This preparation ensured the effectiveness of the k-means clustering algorithm, guaranteeing the discovery of well-separated and meaningful customer segments. Utilizing the pre-processed data, I successfully identified customer clusters based on recency, frequency, and monetary value.

This comprehensive journey not only showcases my proficiency in customer analysis techniques but also highlights my ability to seamlessly integrate theoretical knowledge with practical applications, fostering a deeper understanding of customer behavior and contributing to data-driven decision-making.
