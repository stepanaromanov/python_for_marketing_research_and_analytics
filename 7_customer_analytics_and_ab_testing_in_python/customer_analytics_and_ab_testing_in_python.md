# Description 

I commenced the course with a concise introduction to the upcoming content, setting the stage for a comprehensive exploration. The focus then shifted to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), where I developed the ability to identify and define meaningful KPIs through a blend of critical thinking and Python tools. This practical and widely applicable approach laid the groundwork for the subsequent discussion on A/B testing.

Building on this foundation, I delved into the dynamic realm of visualizing, manipulating, and exploring KPIs as they evolve over time. Examples were utilized to demonstrate how to work with datetime objects, enabling the calculation of metrics per unit time. Techniques for graphing different data segments and applying smoothing functions were explored to uncover hidden trends. The chapter culminated in a comprehensive walkthrough, demonstrating how exploratory data analysis of customer data can pinpoint issues, introducing various functions in a highly generalizable manner.

Transitioning seamlessly into A/B testing, I acquired the mathematical knowledge and skills necessary for designing and successfully planning such tests. This involved determining experimental units, calculating sample sizes, and an introduction to the functions and code essential for statistical testing. Post A/B test execution, I mastered the art of data analysis and effective communication of results.

To enrich the understanding of statistical significance and confidence intervals, I interwove theoretical concepts with practical tools, demonstrating how to calculate them directly from the data. The chapter concluded with insights into visually and effectively communicating these results.

This holistic approach not only equips me with a strong theoretical foundation but also demonstrates my ability to apply these concepts practically using Python tools, ensuring a well-rounded skill set in data analysis and experimental design.
