# Description 

I have acquired a solid foundation in Market Basket Analysis, mastering the intricacies of association rules, metrics, and pruning techniques. This knowledge has been applied to enhance the promotional and product placement strategies for a small grocery store.

Within the realm of association rules, I have delved into six essential metrics—supply, confidence, lift, conviction, leverage, and Zhang's metric—quantifying and evaluating relationships between various items. Applying these metrics, I successfully assisted both a library and an e-book seller in optimizing their offerings based on customer decisions.

The core challenge of Market Basket Analysis lies in translating extensive customer decisions into a concise set of valuable rules. I tackled this challenge by employing the Apriori algorithm and implementing strategies such as pruning and aggregation. Subsequently, I applied these methods to help a retailer in selecting an effective physical store layout and executing product cross-promotions.

I further honed my skills by understanding how visualizations guide the pruning process and summarize results, often manifesting as itemsets or rules. Three key visualizations—heatmaps, scatterplots, and parallel coordinates plots—were mastered and subsequently applied to assist a movie streaming service in optimizing its content strategy.

This comprehensive experience underscores my ability to not only grasp the theoretical aspects of Market Basket Analysis but also to apply this knowledge practically in diverse scenarios, driving effective decision-making for businesses.
