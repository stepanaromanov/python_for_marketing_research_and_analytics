# Description 

I embarked on a comprehensive exploration of machine learning methods applied in the context of marketing. This journey covered diverse machine learning types, data preparation techniques, and the execution of end-to-end models to grasp their efficacy.

Specifically, I delved into churn prediction fundamentals, applying logistic regression and decision tree models to predict and understand customer churn. This involved a detailed analysis of the results to extract valuable insights into the underlying drivers of churn.

Expanding my expertise, I delved into the basics of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and its various calculation methodologies. Leveraging this knowledge, I constructed customer-level purchase features, employing linear regression to predict next month's transactions. This process allowed for a nuanced understanding of customer behavior and purchase patterns.

Further refining my skills, I immersed myself in customer segmentation based on product purchase history. Utilizing two distinct models, I gained insights into the purchasing patterns of customers and successfully grouped them into well-defined and interpretable customer segments.

This hands-on experience not only demonstrates my proficiency in applying machine learning techniques to marketing challenges but also highlights my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex data sets, ultimately contributing to informed decision-making in marketing strategies.
