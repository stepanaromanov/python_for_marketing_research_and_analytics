# Description 

I embarked on a comprehensive exploration of machine learning methods applied in the context of marketing. This journey covered diverse machine learning types, data preparation techniques, and the execution of end-to-end models to grasp their efficacy.

Specifically, I delved into churn prediction fundamentals, applying logistic regression and decision tree models to predict and understand customer churn. This involved a detailed analysis of the results to extract valuable insights into the underlying drivers of churn.

Expanding my expertise, I delved into the basics of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and its various calculation methodologies. Leveraging this knowledge, I constructed customer-level purchase features, employing linear regression to predict next month's transactions. This process allowed for a nuanced understanding of customer behavior and purchase patterns.

Further refining my skills, I immersed myself in customer segmentation based on product purchase history. Utilizing two distinct models, I gained insights into the purchasing patterns of customers and successfully grouped them into well-defined and interpretable customer segments.

This hands-on experience not only demonstrates my proficiency in applying machine learning techniques to marketing challenges but also highlights my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex data sets, ultimately contributing to informed decision-making in marketing strategies.

## Customer churn

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship or subscription with a company or service provider. It represents the rate at which customers stop using a company's products or services within a specific period. Churn is an important metric for businesses as it directly impacts revenue, growth, and customer retention.

## Context

In the context of the Churn dataset, the churn label indicates whether a customer has churned or not. A churned customer is one who has decided to discontinue their subscription or usage of the company's services. On the other hand, a non-churned customer is one who continues to remain engaged and retains their relationship with the company.

Understanding customer churn is crucial for businesses to identify patterns, factors, and indicators that contribute to customer attrition. By analyzing churn behavior and its associated features, companies can develop strategies to retain existing customers, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce customer turnover. Predictive modeling techniques can also be applied to forecast and proactively address potential churn, enabling companies to take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers.

## File

The testing file for the churn dataset consists of 64,374 customer records and serves as a separate dataset for evaluating the performance and generalization capabilities of trained churn prediction models. Each record in the testing file corresponds to a customer and contains the same set of features as the training file, such as age, gender, tenure, usage frequency, support calls, payment delay, subscription type, contract length, total spend, and last interaction. However, the churn labels are not included in the testing file as they are used for assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of the churn prediction models. The testing file allows businesses to assess the predictive power of their trained models on unseen data and gain insights into how well the models generalize to new customers. By analyzing the model's performance on the testing file, businesses can gauge the effectiveness of their churn prediction strategies and make informed decisions to optimize customer retention efforts.
